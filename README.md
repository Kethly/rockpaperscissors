# This was a project done for the odin project curriculum.

The game is simple, win the most out of 5 rounds of rock paper scissors.  If you don't, you simply lose.

Challenges and Current Problems I acknowledge:
- The design was definitely one of the hardest parts to implement.  I had to plan out the positioning and structuring of the flexboxes.
  - This was evident in certain parts such as the computer choosing its randomized choice.  I had to figure out how to use setTimeout to create a pattern that the choosing would follow.  For example, for the time to delay for the action I used x * timeout in a loop to futuristically to create the animation.
- My coding design and layout is not the greatest right now.  It lacks proper comments and structure that would be more efficient and easier to read.  
- It was also one of my first times being able to understand and apply better arrow functions and it really helped my code when combined with commas and ternary operators.
Interesting/Notable Features:
- Instead of a simple randomized choice for the opponent.  I decided to go a more interesting route of using that randomized choice and making the program do a for loop up to that number.  That way I would be able to make the computer seem like it was choosing its option (to the perspective of the user).  I used a combination of id's and modulus to loop through that pattern.
- Adding a basic scoreboard 
- Using flexboxes to structure the page
